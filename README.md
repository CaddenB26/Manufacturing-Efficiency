# Manufacturing Efficiency


## Executive Summary:

  I tracked a companies manufacturing defects using MS Excel and R-studio to come up with a plan to reduce the defects happening to the semiconductors being made by 15%. While conducting the analysis for the manufacturing defects I also conducted a separate project to increase the capacity size for the lines by 20%. 


### Business Problem: 

  In a manufacturing facility located in Tijauna, Mexico there has been an issue of defects increasing within semiconductors due to an increase of demand for their products. The best course of action to fix this issue is hidden within the data they have been collected of the 3 production lines defects. With the growth of demand they are also experiencing a capacity issue for their semiconductors within the production line they would like to solve with an increase in their production lines.



### Methodology: 

1. R-studio - hypothesis test, box plot, scatterplot
   
2. Excel - pivot table, VLOOKUP, bar chart

3. Tableau - dashboard


### Skills:

R-Studio: data analysis algorithms

Excel: data analysis functions, simple Excel functions (SUM, MEAN, TOTAL, etc.)

Data visualization: dashboard, bar chart




### Results & Business Recommendation: 

  Viewing all 3 lines separtly it was easy to see that the defect with the most problems was solder bridge which was the most likely defects within 2 lines and the second most likely in the last line. When combining the data together the result that was expected was what we saw with solder bridge being the most common defect. There was a realization that the defects that happened were most likely reoccurring defects with many defects happening very few times. The end result was to retrain the employees on all the defects that were experienced at 15 times and up to help decrease the defects by a mininum of 15%. As for the capacity issue we were able to find plenty of room for each of the lines to increase by 20%.



What was implemented to complete the project:

1. Construction started one line at a time to increase capacity for each line
2. while construction occured the employees on that line trained
3. Training became an annual requirement to avoid defects down the road.

With training happening while construction goes on there should be a small dip in production and with annual training there should be a decrease on defects 

### Next Steps: 

1. Keep an eye on data for defects so the issue doesn't keep happening
2. Hire more employees to better fill the new capacity and the demand
